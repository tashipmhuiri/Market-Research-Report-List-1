<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dive Buoys Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SMB</li><li>DSMB</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dive buoys are essential tools in diving operations, designed to enhance safety and visibility underwater. The SMB (Surface Marker Buoy) is deployed by divers during ascent to signal their position at the surface, ensuring they're visible to boats and surface support. On the other hand, the DSMB (Delayed Surface Marker Buoy) is released during deeper dives and ascended later, providing safety by marking the diver's exit point, particularly in crowded waters. Both types emphasize diver safety and situational awareness underwater.</p></p>
