<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Cooled Trap Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Right Angle"</li><li>"Coaxial"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The water-cooled trap market can be categorized into two main types: right angle and coaxial. Right angle traps feature a design that allows for the efficient diversion of condensate at a 90-degree angle, optimizing space and installation in tight areas. Coaxial traps, on the other hand, utilize a concentric design where the cooling water flows alongside the vapor path, enhancing heat exchange efficiency. Both types serve specific applications in industrial processes, ensuring effective temperature management and energy conservation.</p></p>
